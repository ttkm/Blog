I created a little **console** you can use to jump to any post without clicking through the menu. It’s inspired by old Steam / CS:Source and fits the green theme. Here’s how to use it.

## Open it

- Press **`/`** (slash) on your keyboard from any page, or  
- Click **search** in the top-right (posts | home | search).

The console pops up with a search box. Don’t worry, it doesn’t run real commands; it just searches post titles and slugs.

## Search and go

- **Type** to filter posts. Matches show up as suggestions (title + slug).
- **⮁** or **Tab** (and **Shift+Tab**) move the highlighted suggestion.
- **Enter** or the **Submit** button take you to the highlighted post.
- You can also **click** a suggestion to go there.

## Close it

- Press **Escape**, or  
- Click the **×** or click outside the panel (on the dark backdrop).

That’s it. Use `/` whenever you want to hop to a post without leaving the keyboard.
